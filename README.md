<h1>The Central Leisure Centre</h1>
<p>First Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute</p>
<p>This website will be used for guests of the Central and Abbey Hotels, prospective members, 
existing members and non members. This website includes a home page with a fixed navigation bar with a 
dropdown menu for smaller devices including links to memberships fees page, opening hours and class 
timetable page, special offers page, contact us page and finally a gallery page. All of these pages 
will have the fixed naigation bar with the dropdown menu for ease of use. Also all pages will have the 
same footer which includes contact information, location using google maps, opening hours and social media links.</p>

<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>A live demo can be found <a href="https://8000-ecf39446-98e0-40d2-a8ad-7c996760c341.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/">here.</a></p>

<h1>UX</h1>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>As a guest of the Central or Abbey Hotels, I expect to see the various facilities
that the leisure centre has to offer, pictures and also the opening times. Also, if I had a query/question
I would like to see contact details or a contact form.</p>
<p>As a prospective member, I expect to see the various facilities that the leisure centre has to offer.
I would like to see a list of classes they do, opening hours, the location, contact details, pictures, social media links, membership fees
and especially if there are any special offers for membership during the year.</p>
<p>As an existing member, I would like to see classes and timetables and a contact form for any queries/questions.</p>
<p>As a non member, who doesn't want to join, I would like to see if classes are available for non members 
and if so, how much do they cost for non members. Also, I would like to see if there is a daily rate  for the swimming pool and/or gym 
and again a contact form for queries/questions.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>My goal in the design of the website was for it to be easy to use and navigate from one to page to the next.
I did not want all the information on one webpage as I felt there would be too much scrolling especially
 on a mobile phone device.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<a target="_blank" href="../wireframes/homepage.jpg">Home Page Wireframe</a><br>
<a target="_blank" href="../wireframes/contactuspage.jpg">Contact Us Page Wireframe</a><br>
<a target="_blank" href="../wireframes/gallery.jpg">Gallery Page Wireframe</a><br>

<a target="_blank" href="../wireframes/openinghrspage.jpg">Opening Hours and Class Timetable Wireframe</a><br>
<a target="_blank" href="../wireframes/specialofferspage.jpg">Special Offers Page Wireframe</a>

<h2>Background Image and Colours</h2>
<p>I used the same background image for phones and another background image for screens larger than 768px throughout the web pages to keep the website consistant. I used https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ 
and selected the background image and this website picked out distinct colours from the image and used these colours throughout the web pages.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
In all the webpages, I have used a fixed navigation bar at the top of each page with a hamburger menu icon for smaller screens using bootstrap. 
I feel this will be easy for users to navigate to each webpage within the site. In the footer, which again is the same for all webpages, due to 
the estential information that I feel the users require is responsive with 4 columns for largers screens, 2 columns for medium screens and 1 
column for smaller screens.<br>

In the home page, I have written a general overview of the leisure centre and have listed the amenities which is again responsive.<br>

In the Opening Hours and Membership page, I used a bootstrap responsive hover table which scrolls horizontally on smaller screens. https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_tables.asp<br>

In the Contact Us page, I got the idea of the form box from "I Love Running" website from the LMS on Code Institute.

In the Gallery page, I used bootstrap image gallery code. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp<br>

I used font awesome for the contact details in the footer section.<br>

I used google fonts to change the font to bitter.<br>

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>
To post the form to proper location as it is only sent to code institute website at the moment (possibly requires javascript - next module)<br>
To increase image size when you hover over it. (possibly requires javascript - next module)
<h1>Technologies</h1>
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap 4.7.0</li>
</ol>

<h1>Testing</h1>
The user (be to existing member/hotel guest or prospective member)
has all the required information in the website and if they require 
further information or a query they can use the form to ask a question.<br>
All links in all webpages are tested and working properly. All external links 
will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"<br> In the contact 
us page, if you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, 
there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' 
attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields 
are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will redirect to code 
institute page.<br>
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on 
multiple mobile devices (iPhone7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility 
and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized that background image: fixed was not 
compatible with iOS browsers. On Chrome and Safari in iOS, the background photo appeared zoomed-in 
and blurry and was not a fixed image while scrolling. I went to tutor support, but they did not have a solution for this error.

<h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. 
The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. 
In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be 
named index.html. To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the 
editor of your choice by pasting git clone

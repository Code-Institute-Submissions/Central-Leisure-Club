<h1>The Central Leisure Centre</h1>
<p>First Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute</p>
<p>This website will be used for guests of the Central and Abbey Hotels, prospective members, 
existing members and non members. This website includes a home page with a fixed navigation bar with a 
dropdown menu for smaller devices including links to memberships fees page, opening hours and class 
timetable page, special offers page, contact us page and finally a gallery page. All of these pages 
will have the fixed naigation bar with the dropdown menu for ease of use. Also all pages will have the 
same footer which includes contact information, location using google maps, opening hours and social media links.</p>

<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>A live demo can be found <a href="https://8000-ecf39446-98e0-40d2-a8ad-7c996760c341.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/">here.</a></p>

<h1>UX</h1>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>As a guest of the Central or Abbey Hotels, I expect to see the various facilities
that the leisure centre has to offer, pictures and also the opening times. Also, if I had a query/question
I would like to see contact details or a contact form.</p>
<p>As a prospective member, I expect to see the various facilities that the leisure centre has to offer.
I would like to see a list of classes they do, opening hours, the location, contact details, pictures, social media links, membership fees
and especially if there are any special offers for membership during the year.</p>
<p>As an existing member, I would like to see classes and timetables and a contact form for any queries/questions.</p>
<p>As a non member, who doesn't want to join, I would like to see if classes are available for non members 
and if so, how much do they cost for non members. Also, I would like to see if there is a daily rate  for the swimming pool and/or gym 
and again a contact form for queries/questions.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>My goal in the design of the website was for it to be easy to use and navigate from one to page to the next.
I did not want all the information on one webpage as I felt there would be too much scrolling especially
 on a mobile phone device.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<a href="../wireframes/openinghrspage.jpg">Opening Hours and Class Timetable Wireframe</a><br>
<a href="../wireframes/specialofferspage.jpg">Special Offers Page Wireframe</a>

<h2>Background Image and Colours</h2>
<p>I used the same background image throughout the web pages to keep the website consistant. I used https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ 
and selected the background image and this website picked out distinct colours from the image and used these colours throughout the web pages.</p>
